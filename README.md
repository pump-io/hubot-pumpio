# pumabot

pumabot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot]. Like all
Hubots, it's configured so it can be deployed on [Heroku][heroku];
however, the production version of pumabot runs on [AJ][]'s server.

You can find pumabot hanging out in `#pump.io` on Freenode.
